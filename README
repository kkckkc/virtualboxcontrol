This is all highly inspired by http://www.pjlnash.co.uk/blog/?p=39 but
with some enhancements

To run: 

 1. Update etc/settings.conf
 2. Start the launchdaemon.bat in your Windows XP VirtualBox
 3. You can now run linux-host/start.sh "notepad.exe" to start notepad in your virtualbox
 4. If you have shared folders set up you can also run
    linux-host/open.sh "<path to file>"
